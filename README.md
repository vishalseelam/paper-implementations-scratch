# Paper Implementations from Scratch

A personal commitment to implement **1 research paper per month** throughout 2025.

## Goal
Build deeper understanding of machine learning and AI research by implementing foundational and cutting-edge papers from scratch, focusing on core concepts.

## 2025 Progress
- [x] January - Word2Vec
- [ ] February  
- [x] March - Transformer (Attention is All You Need)
- [ ] April
- [x] May - REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- [ ] June
- [ ] July
- [x] August - DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models)
- [ ] September
- [ ] October
- [ ] November
- [ ] December

Each implementation will include:
- Clean, well-documented code
- Mathematical derivations where relevant
- Experiments and results
- Key insights and learnings
